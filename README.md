# Custom Hooks and Functions

This package is ment for me and my friends to use when building various websites with React, so we can have one place for the util hooks and functions.
I don't promise for this to be well maintained, but feel free to fork the project or do whatever you wish with it.

In the future I do plan to add description for all the hooks and functions, add new ones and refactor the current ones if need be.

Here is a list of the current ones:

# Hooks

- useButtonPress
- useClient - for NextJS
- useDetectSwipe
- useDetectTouchScreen
- useElementDimensions
- useElementPosition
- useInterval
- useIsomorphiclayoutEffect
- usePreventBodyScroll
- useSmallScreen
- useWindowDimensions

# Functions

- breakpointToNumber
- scrollToTop
- detectTouchScreen

# Classes

- DragManager
